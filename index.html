                                 What I am most passionate about in designing websites is the fact that I am able to challenge my creativity and also I am doing what i love 
                                 and I as result my work is top tier and world class. I believe no one can know everything about coding so I push myself to learn something

                                 Apart from being a geek and staring at my screen all day writing codes, I am very good at playing chess and swimming.That is what I 
                                 do when I want to unwind and relax .Other than that I am a reader and I love reading fictional books and thrillers.Not forgetting my almost useless talent that I have many handwrittings.My other passion is mental health and I believe it should be advocated for at all times
